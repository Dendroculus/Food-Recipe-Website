    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <p>In Taisho era Japan, a secret organization known as "Demon
        Slayer Corps" has waged a war against demons for centuries.
        Demons are former humans who posses supernatural abilities such
        as enhanced strength, rapid regeneration, and unique powers reffered
        to as "Blood Demon Arts". Demons can only be killed if they are exposed
        direct sunlight, decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy called Nichirin, 
        or injected with a poison extracted from wisteria flowers.
