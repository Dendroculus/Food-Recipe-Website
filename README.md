## 📌 About This Project

**CELESTIAL** is a minimal, single-page website template built purely with **HTML and CSS**. It was created as a learning exercise to explore clean navigation patterns and provide a simple, beautiful foundation for anyone wanting to share their culinary creations online.

Whether you're a home cook sharing family recipes, a food blogger documenting your adventures, or just need a simple portfolio, CELESTIAL offers an elegant starting point. It features a responsive three-column navigation bar and a sleek CSS-only hover dropdown menu – no JavaScript required!

## 🧩 How to Use & Customize

Making CELESTIAL your own is easy:

1.  **Change Title/Logo**: Edit the text inside `<li class="celestial">...</li>` in `index.html`. You can replace `CELESTIAL 💫` with your site name or an `<img>` tag for a logo.
2.  **Update Left Navigation Links**: Modify the `<a>` tags within `<ul class="left">...</ul>`.
3.  **Update Right Icons/Links**: Change the `<img>` tags inside `<ul class="right">...</ul>`. Consider using inline SVGs for better quality and styling options.
4.  **Edit Dropdown Menu Items**: Update the list items (`<li>`) inside `<ul class="recipes-dropdown">...</ul>`.
5.  **Customize Styles**: Open `styles.css` and adjust colors, fonts, spacing, etc. The template uses the *Montserrat* font locally – make sure it's in the `/font` folder or switch to a web font via CSS `@import`.
